# Docker compose yaml file for my Homeassistant server. 
It is use to run mainly Home Assistant and required containers in my setup.

The *"server"* is overkill and at the same time under setup. But it is hardware that I had in hand. 
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2400G  
- RAM: 16GB  
- Motherboard: Asrock Fatal1ty X370 Gaming K4  
- SSD: Sandisk 256 GB
